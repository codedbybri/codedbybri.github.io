          <p>In ATM, I have learned a lot so far. MY knowledge of computers and technology will and has increased my abilities. Not only in the ATM class, but with other classes too. I can use tools and programs I use in ATM to help me with projects or presentations with other classes. In all, ATM is a really good program to learn and advance your skills in technology.</p>
